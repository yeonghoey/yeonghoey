#+TITLE: Streamlining your search with Chrome Omnibox

* Omnibox?
*Omnibox* is a nickname for Chrome's address bar.
As you know, you can search on Google there
when you put text other than URLs.

Incidentally, *did you know that you can search on whatever search engine
you like there?* Let me explain how.

* Search Engines configuration

Open *Search Engines* menu:

A window like the following will show up:


[[file:img/screenshot_2016-12-27_00-22-14.png]]

* How it works

There are 3 columns in the *Other search engines*.
You may have some search engine definitions in there,
because Chrome automatically identifies and registers search engines there.
You can simply ignore them.
Each column signifies *Name*, *Keyword* and *Search String* respectively.

Let's take a look at how each element cooperates:

* Find the Search String

To find *Search Strings* for your favorite search engines,
you need to do simple experiments.

1. Enter search words into the search engine.
2. Recognize the words you just entered from the result URL.
3. Replace them with ~%s~

Here is an example: (featuring [[http://symbolhound.com][SymbolHound]])

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
http://symbolhound.com/ (default)

http://symbolhound.com/?q=yeongho (searched 'yeongho')

http://symbolhound.com/?q=%s (*Search String*)
#+END_QUOTE

* My Search Engines configuration

I listed my *Search Engines* configuration for those who feel frustrated with
*Search Strings*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  bookmarks     b   chrome://bookmarks/#q=%s
  history       h   chrome://history/?#q=%s
  github        gh  https://github.com/search?q=%s
  google        g   http://www.google.com/search?q=%s
  google image  i   http://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=%s
  naver         n   https://search.naver.com/search.naver?query=%s
  naver endic   e   http://endic.naver.com/search.nhn?query=%s
  naver krdic   k   http://krdic.naver.com/search.nhn?query=%s
  symbolhound   s   http://symbolhound.com/?q=%s
  thesaurus     t   http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/%s
  youtube       y   https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%s
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Bookmark Search Chrome Extension

[[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-search/hhmokalkpaiacdofbcddkogifepbaijk][Bookmark Search]] is an extension that uses *Omnibox*.
Like other custom search engines, you can trigger it with the *Keyword*, ~bm~.

The best thing about it is *auto-completion*.
You can open your bookmarks in a single step
without knowing the exact bookmark that you desire for.

I put ~pyth~ in there, and
it shows the list of my bookmarks related to *Python*.
I can open reference documents in just a single step with this extension.

* Summary

It may seem that this work is just to save a single step.

However, how many times do you search in a day?
One step save for every single search would be a huge save.
In addition to that, ease of search makes you look things up more,
which could leads you to working more effectively.

Happy search!
